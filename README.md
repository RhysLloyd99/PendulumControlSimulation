# PendulumControlSimulation
This is a real time simulation of an inverted pendulum on a cart featuring a tunable PID controller for pendulum angle and cart velocity.

## Features
- Real time pendulum and cart animation
- PID control stabilising upright position of pendulum
- PID control minimising cart velocity
- Adjustable control gains and properties in control panel
- Real time graph plotting angle, angular velocity, cart position, cart velocity and control input
- Manual control of cart acceleration with arrow keys

## How-to
- Install requirements.txt
- Run main.py
- Interact using buttons or keyboard shortcuts
